The Panama Canal is an artificial waterway connecting the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans, located in Panama. Completed in 1914, this remarkable engineering feat revolutionized global trade by significantly reducing the time ships needed to travel between oceans. The canal operates using a series of locks to raise and lower ships through its 50-mile route.
