The Golden Gate Bridge, completed in 1937, spans the Golden Gate Strait in San Francisco, California. It is one of the most recognizable landmarks in the United States and a marvel of suspension bridge design. Painted in its iconic "International Orange" color, the bridge stretches 1.7 miles and remains a popular tourist attraction.
